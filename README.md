<h2 align="center">Generating scores visualization from Random Forest predictions</h1>

This is a complementary Script for generating a simple visualization for the prediction scores from my previous [Script](https://github.com/angelomaia/NIR_RF_Prediction_R), as you can see in the image below.

In this case the RPIQ has been used as the indicator of prediction performance because we are dealing with the prediction of elemental concentrations from infrared spectral data, and the RPIQ is the current most trustworthy parameter to evaluate the results.

I provide here a step-by-step code, including examples such as the models and test datasets generated in the previous [Script](https://github.com/angelomaia/NIR_RF_Prediction_R), so you can try it out by yourself.

Any other statistical parameter generated in the models evaluation could be used instead of RPIQ, like RÂ² or RMSE, but the plot parameters need to be be rearranged in the code.
